It began as a private nonsectarian tertiary school named General Emilio Aguinaldo College (GEAC)-Cavite and was managed by the Yaman Lahi Foundation. The college started with the Division of Health and Sciences and the Division of Arts and Sciences, offering courses such as Education, Elementary Education, Secretarial Administration, Nursing, Foods and Nutrition, Midwifery, Radiologic Technology, and Business Administration Technical courses were later included to help the community youth who could not afford a four-year college education. In 1987, ownership and management were transferred to Frere (Saint) Benilde Romancon Educational Foundation, Inc., making it a Catholic institution and a member of the De La Salle University System. The college was then named De La Salle University - Emilio Aguinaldo College (DLSU-EAC). In 1992, the name was changed to De La Salle University - Aguinaldo and eventually became De La Salle University - Dasmarinas in 1997. Over the years, the university has expanded its programs and colleges, achieving excellence in regional studies and academic programs relevant to the CALABARZON area."

Student files the written complaints as endorsed by the adviser. For academic matters, the student must file within the semester the cause of the complaint, unless it is about the final grade. In this case, a student may file a complaint until the second week after the grades have been released.\n2. The Faculty adviser conducts a one-on-one conference with the student/faculty/staff respondent within five (5) school days from filing of the written complaint. If the faculty adviser fails to resolve the case, s/he refers it to the department chair for a formal complaint.\n3. If the department chair fails to resolve the case within five (5) school days, s/he refers it to the dean of the college, who then creates an ad hoc committee to deliberate on and resolve the conflict within 5 school days.\n4. If the decision by the Department Chair/College Dean is not satisfactory to the student complainants, the case may be elevated to the SGB chaired by the OSS Dean.\n5. The OSS Dean convenes the SGB, which deliberates and decides on the case within seven (7) school days. The decision of the SGB as chaired by the OSS Dean is appealable to the VCAR within five (5) school days from receipt of the decision.\nGuidelines during hearings and deliberation of the SGB:\n1. The OSS Dean acts as the chair and presiding officer during the hearing, starting the proceedings by reading the complaint and reply/ies filed before the SGB.\n2. Once a decision is made by the SGB, all parties are furnished with copies of the decision. If the complainant is not satisfied with the board\u2019s decision, s/he may move for a reconsideration of the case with the board within forty-eight (48) hours after receipt of the decision.\n3. If the complainant fails to file an appeal for reconsideration within forty-eight (48) hours after receipt thereof, the decision becomes final and executory."
